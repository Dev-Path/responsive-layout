# Responsive Layouts Challenge 1

* Avoid using fixed widths and heights.

* Use percentages to make the layout responsive.

* When ems are used are font size, they look at their parent font size to know what to be set to.

* rems refers to root ems. Which could be set in your html selector or in your css root::

* ems set on anything else other than font size don't reference the parent. They reference the font size of that element
